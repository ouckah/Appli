# HTML Parser & Semantics Logs
**Author:** Aidan Ouckama  
**Date:** 11-21-2025
**Purpose:**  
- Rebuilding, previous MVP was vibecoded and I was lowkey losing track of how it worked
- Sectioning out the pipeline to be scalable / modular, have a specific folder for each stage
- Transition from MVP to working product

**Notes / Tracking:**  
- Got done with the DOM Realizer, working on HTML parsing
- DOM Realizer fetches HTML with PlayWright, then extracts interactable elements with BeautifulSoup (Text Inputs, Dropdowns, Buttons, etc.)
- Made scaffolding for LLM Models for extracting semantics from interactable elements, starting the pipeline to the PlayWright Plan Builder

**TODO / Future:**
- Finish up the Semantics Extractor in the HTML parsing stage
- Build the rest of the models for each interactable HTML element (might not have multiple models for this, may change in the future)
- E2E testing from DOM Realizer -> HTML Parser, see if this transition works
